										<h2 class="major">Personal Information</h2>
										<p>My name: Xuyi Wu <br> student number: s3733582 <br>Email address: s3733582@student.rmit.edu.au <br> I come from China, I used to serve in the army as an sergeant before I came here and majored in Info Tech. I can speak fluent Mandarin and my English is not too bad(at least I think so), I also have a basic understanding of Japanese and Cantonese. I love music especially classical music and I'm good at playing the violin.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Interest in IT </h2>
										<p>I love games, especially computer games, so do my parents and grandparents. My father bought a FC in 1990 so my childhood was acompanied by all kinds of games. My 5 years old birthday present was a game CD of StarCraft then WarCraft3 and other kinds of games every year. In 2006, my parents started to play WOW and I joined them shortly after. Thanks to Blizzard, the game showed me a fantastic world that I had never seen before and I was deeply attracted by the art of the game so I decided to be a game developer. <br><br>Like most of the students in China, I grew up，took the College entrance examination and admitted by a good military school which was known for its eminent achievement in the field of Info Tech. However, instead of training to be a programmer, I found the course paid more attention to the military skills so I quit school. At that time, if I want to continue my study, Australia seemed to be the best choice for me, so I chose to come to RMIT, not only because of its excellent location but also because of its well-known IT course where I can learn the skills and knowledge I want to be a game developer.</p>

Although I don't like the kind of game exclusively for the gambling industry, I can still gain experience here so I can apply for another position in the future.<br><br>This position requires the applicant to have experience in Javascript and HTML5 related technologies and OOP in JS. The applicant will be nice to have skills about jQuery, knowledge of PIXI, Phaser or any other HTML5 game Frameworks and PureMVC Framework. Experience in creating any type of games online portfolio of personal work, games, experimental and personal projects is also important.<br><br>Currently, I only have a basic understanding of Javascript and HTML5 but these two important skills are involved in the courses and I believe after three years of study, I will master these two skills. I have no idea about OOS even after searching it online, I still find it difficult to understand but with my further study of JS, I think it will be much easier in the near future. I don't have any experience in creating games now and no nothing about the game Frameworks but I will try to learn the knowledge during my spare time after I have a basic understanding of JAVA this semester.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
											<p>The first time I did this test was four years ago, I have done this test many times during the years, and the results have never changed, the description is definitely me, so I think I'm a typical ESTP. That's also the reason why I left the army because the highly organized environments was really a challenge for me.<br><br>Most of the time, I can easily integrate into a group，handle problems quickly and efficiently, but sometimes I may get too caught in the moment, take things too far, and run roughshod over more sensitive people.<br><br>Since I'm an ESTP, most of the times, I tend to be the team leader, form a team of some Chinese and some English speakers and according to my experience last semester, this method can always achieve good results since different cultural backgrounds can bring more ideas and sources of information, and compared with Chinese, English speakers are undoubtedly much more good at English presentation, negotiation and searching English information.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><embed src="images/learn.pdf" width="450" height="480"></a>
											<h3 class="major">Learning Style Test</h3>
											<p>Compared with the Myers-Briggs test, this test is less meaningful to me since the result is not necessarily accurate. Some questions like "When you see the word "cat," what do you do first?" are not particularly suitable for people who is not a native English speaker since I will say the word "cat" to myself when I see the English word, but when I think about the Chinese character of cat, I will picture a cat in my mind.<br><br>According to the test, I'm a "hands­on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn and I learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing. So I may pay more attention to a practical task.<br><br>When forming a team, I can cooperate with people who is a visual learner or auditory learner to make the team more perfect.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Big Five Personality Test</h3>
											<p>This test is a bit like the Myers-Briggs test but told me more about my personality.<br><br>The test shows that I'm a critical thinker and often analyze how things and people around me could be improved. I'm keenly aware of the ways in which others disappoint me, and I'm not afraid to point out what is wrong in the team. It also says that I do not expect help from anyone, and instead put the onus on myself to attain what I want.<br><br>I think the results are accurate cause I tend to point out the potential problems in a team directly and when it comes to teamwork, if someone can't meet my requirement, I prefer to take on his duty myself. As a result, I want to find more capable and responsible teammates, otherwise I have to take on too many responsibilities. </p>

							<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
							<p><label for="name">Overview:</label>My project idea is creating a FAQ and implementing it as a chatterbot. It will be presented in the form of an application and will support both text input and voice input. The chatterbot will have the ability to chat with the user, answer the user's questions or execute the user's command. It not only can be simply used as a chatterbot to relieve the users' stress but also can be ported to another platform. For example, it can perform as online customer service on a website, respond to the players in a game and even give some advice to help the users making an important decision.<br><br><label for="name">Motivation:</label>The reason why I want to do the project is very simple: It is the project I am most likely to accomplish in the near future. Of course, I want to develop a game which is also my dream, but the truth is that I'm just on my way and I still have a long way to go. So currently, I only want to start with a chatterbot which is very easy to implement since it is not an AI, I can even do it using Java. The chatterbot is undoubtedly very useful and can be used in everywhere, every field to change the people's life.<br><br><label for="name">Description:</label>The chatterbot will be able to customize, self-optimize and self-regulate. <br><br>First of all, as a chatterbot application, it has the basic function of chat, and according to the users' requirement, It will be customized into different versions. The version used for games can answer the players' questions about the game, tell them how to complete the task, guide the players to become stronger, collect the players' feedback. The version used for navigation can show the users the information they want in a website, tell the users what they can do or should do when they are confused. The version used for customer service can reply to the users according to their needs, give them advice when they need, answer their questions and collect feedback. The version used for family can help the parents take care of their children, answer the questions about the homework. All in all, the chatterbot will be easily customized according to the user's need.<br><br>Secondly, It will have the ability to self-optimize. The program will have a corpus and it will use the information collected from the users to update the corpus to perform better. It will also download information online and use up-to-date information to respond to the user. If the user is satisfied with the response, it will save the information into its database, otherwise, it will delete it. The data will also be updated frequently to avoid error and what the engineers need to do is fixing the potential bugs and add some features according to the users' needs.<br><br>The most powerful and difficult feature of this program is self-regulation. The program will have the ability to feel the moods of the users and make different reactions to different users. For example, It will never joke with a person who is sad and it will try to soothe the user's emotion when the user is angry. Just like big data, It will provide different information to different people, identify the signs of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, select information according to users' preference. It can be used for counseling and can even help people with depression because it can always find the best words to reply immediately, no matter when or where.<br><br><label for="name">Tools and Technologies:</label>The chat part of the program will be very easy to implement, all we need is just a computer and a speech recognition system but the other feature will be quite difficult to achieve. Currently, I have no ideas about how to achieve self-optimize and self-regulate, it may require very complicated logic algorithm or this will be more like an AI, need the help of a biological expert. It may require some future technology to help implement these features and It may require cloud computing to support its operation.<br><br><label for="name">Skills Required:</label>It requires at least one computer language like Java to complete the framework of the program but it can only handle the hardcoded part which is designed by the programmer and it may require other computer languages like SQL to built the database, Python or C++ to achieve more complex arithmetic logic. It also requires the skills about the recurrent neural network to identify the users' emotions, the skills to create dynamic memory networks, skills about LexRank, TextRank to answer the users' questions. The system optimization skill will be also needed to make this app available to multiple platforms.<br><br><label for="name">Outcome:</label>If the project is successful, it will change people's lives in many ways. The most significant change is that we will have a reliable robot friend who can answer almost all the questions and listen patiently to our thoughts. Some jobs like Customer services will disappear slowly but there will be a broader employment space for programmers, engineers and salesman. People with mental illness like depression will get better treatment since there will always be someone who can listen to their hearts. The world will be more efficient and harmonious.</p>
